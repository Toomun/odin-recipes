    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose wheat flour.</li>
        <li>2/3 cup granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of baking powder.</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of milk.</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>1 large egg.</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200Â°C and place paper liners in a muffin tin, 
        or lightly grease the tin if you don't have liners.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. 
        Make sure all the dry ingredients are well integrated.</li>
        <li>In another smaller bowl, combine the milk, vegetable oil, egg, and 
        vanilla essence. Beat the mixture until you get a homogeneous consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredient pan and mix everything 
        together with a spatula or wooden spoon. The key to fluffy muffins is not to over-mix; the dough should be slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips to the batter and mix lightly to distribute evenly.</li>
        <li>Fill each muffin pan cavity about 2/3 full with batter. This will allow the muffins plenty of room to rise while they bake.</li>
        <li>Bake the muffins in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Once done, remove the muffins from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
