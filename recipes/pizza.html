    <p>This delicious grilled pizza is perfect to share with family and friends on a sunny afternoon or as a
    novelty option for your outdoor events. Enjoy its smoky and crunchy flavor that makes it so special!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 prepared pizza dough.</li>
        <li>2 cups of grated mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper.</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the grill: light the grill and make sure it is very hot before placing the pizza.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough: If you're using pre-made dough, make sure to leave it out at room temperature 
        so it's easier to roll out. If you're making the dough at home, make sure it's not too thick or too thin. 
        Stretch it with your hands or with a rolling pin until you get the desired shape for your pizza</li>
        <li>Grill the dough: Place the dough on the hot grill and cook for about 2-3 minutes or until it starts 
        to bubble on top and the bottom is golden brown. Be sure to keep an eye on it to prevent it from burning.</li>
        <li>Flip the dough: Carefully use tongs or a spatula to flip the dough over and cook the other side for another 
        2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce and ingredients: Remove the cooked dough from the grill and place it on a pizza plate or board. 
        Spread a layer of tomato sauce or barbecue sauce on the surface of the dough. Add a generous amount of shredded 
        mozzarella cheese, then spread your toppings of choice on top.</li>
        <li>Grill the pizza: Place the pizza back on the hot grill and cook with the lid closed so the cheese melts and the 
        toppings cook. This will take about 4-6 minutes, depending on the intensity of the heat and the thickness of the dough.</li>
        <li>Ready to Enjoy!: Once the pizza is cooked through and the cheese has melted, remove it from the grill. Drizzle a little olive
        oil over the surface to give it a final touch and bring out the flavors</li>
    </ol>
